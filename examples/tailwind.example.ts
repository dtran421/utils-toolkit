// As I said in the `api-client.example.ts` file, this package doesn't have React installed,
// so there's no way to demonstrate it realistically here. However, here's a snippet of what
// it would look like:

/* 
import { cn } from "utils-toolkit";

const Component = ({ someProps, darkMode }) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn("text-black", {
        "text-white": darkMode,
      })}
    >
      Hello world!
    </div>
  );
}; 
*/
