Big documentation updates, revamped some utilities:

- Return types now support discriminant unions (type inference!)
- README now has documentation on how to use functions and types
- There are example files to demonstrate usage in an IDE environment
- Updated unit tests to be more comprehensive (including falsy tests and null/undefined)
- .gitignore now ignores .DS_Store (thanks Apple)
